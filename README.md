# Luiza Gusmão — Personal Website

This repository contains my personal website, built with Astro and designed to present my professional journey, technical expertise, and evolution as an engineer and creator.  
The project reflects my experience in QA, automation, SDET practices, and modern front‑end engineering.

## 🚀 About the Project

This website was created to consolidate my professional presence and communicate my technical strengths with clarity and structure.  
It highlights:

- my 16+ years of experience in technology  
- my transition from Support → QA → Automation → SDET  
- my engineering mindset and product‑oriented approach  
- my work in automation frameworks, testing, CI/CD, and workflow optimization  

The site is fully static in its current version (1.0), optimized for performance, accessibility, and clean architecture.
