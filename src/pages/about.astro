        My Story
      </h2>
      <p class="text-body text-neutralTech-700 dark:text-neutralTech-200">
        My career spans more than 16 years across different layers of technology. I began in technical support, where I developed strong analytical skills, resilience, and a deep understanding of real‑world systems. Over time, I transitioned into Quality Assurance, refining my ability to design tests, analyze risks, and ensure reliability. This evolution naturally led me into automation and, eventually, into the role of SDET — combining development, testing, and engineering practices to build scalable and maintainable solutions. Today, I also create my own products, applying everything I’ve learned to build tools that bring clarity, structure, and efficiency to teams.

        Core Values
      </h2>
      <p class="text-body text-neutralTech-700 dark:text-neutralTech-200">
        I believe in engineering grounded in clarity, consistency, and purpose. My work is guided by principles such as transparency, thoughtful design, and long‑term maintainability. I value processes that empower teams, communication that reduces friction, and solutions that balance technical depth with practical execution. Above all, I prioritize building systems that people can trust.

        Mission
      </h2>
      <p class="text-body text-neutralTech-700 dark:text-neutralTech-200">
        My mission is to elevate software quality through automation, engineering excellence, and well‑structured workflows. I aim to help teams move faster with confidence, reduce operational risk, and adopt practices that support sustainable growth. Whether through automation frameworks, internal tools, or product development, my focus is always on creating clarity and enabling better decision‑making.

        Vision for the Future
      </h2>
      <p class="text-body text-neutralTech-700 dark:text-neutralTech-200">
        Looking ahead, I aim to continue creating tools and engineering practices that support teams globally. Each product I build — including FocusFlow and Donna — strengthens my skills and shapes the way I approach the next challenge. My long‑term vision is to grow as a creator and engineer, eventually developing a scalable, impactful product in the tech space. Whether it emerges from my current work or from future ideas, my goal is to build solutions that simplify complexity, elevate engineering culture, and help people work with more structure, intention, and clarity.
