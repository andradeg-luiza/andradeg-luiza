      <h2 class="text-h2 text-brand-wine">My Story</h2>
      <p class="text-body text-neutralTech-700">
        With over 16 years of experience in technology, my career has evolved through multiple layers of the software lifecycle. I began in technical support, transitioned into Quality Assurance, and expanded into Software Development Engineering in Test (SDET). This path allowed me to develop a strong foundation in automation, modern engineering practices, and product-oriented thinking. My work is grounded in clarity, reliability, and long-term value — qualities that guide every system, workflow, and solution I help build.

      <p class="text-body text-neutralTech-700">
        I believe in engineering as a discipline that requires consistency, transparency, and a commitment to continuous improvement. My approach is centered on building solutions that are both robust and elegant, balancing technical depth with practical execution. I value clear communication, thoughtful design, and processes that empower teams to deliver with confidence.
